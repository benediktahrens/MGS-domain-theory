# Domain theory and denotational semantics

Lecture notes with exercises for the introductory course on *domain theory and
denotational semantics* at the
[Midlands Graduate School (MGS)
2023](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/events/MGS23/).

## Abstract

*Denotational semantics aims to understand computer programs by assigning
mathematical meaning to the syntax of a programming language. In this course we
will study a simple functional programming language called PCF. Notably, this
language has general recursion through a fixed point operator. This means a
simple denotational semantics based on sets is not suitable. Instead, we
interpret the types of PCF as certain partially ordered sets leading to domain
theory and Scott's model of PCF in particular. The central theorems of soundness
and computational adequacy, formulated and proved by Plotkin, then tell us that
a PCF program computes to a value if and only if their interpretations in the
model are equal.*
