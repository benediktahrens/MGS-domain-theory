\chapter{Acknowledgements}

It is my pleasure to thank Mart\'in Escard\'o who introduced me to the beautiful
subjects of denotational semantics and domain theory. I am also grateful for his
comments on earlier drafts of these notes.

Additionally, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the teaching assistants
Ayberk Tosun and Josh Chen for proof-reading and suggesting several
revisions.

Finally, I am grateful to the \emph{MGS 2023} participants Matt Russel
and Paul Levy whose comments have led to improvements in these notes.
